dreamfilm-xbmc
==============
dreamfilm.se plugin for XBMC. Not yet published to a repository.

Installation
------------
Download master.zip, unzip, rename to plugin.video.dreamfilm and zip as plugin.video.dreamfilm-0.x.y.zip (where x,y are version identifiers).
The zip-file can then be installed on XBMC from the add-on manager.

NOTE: If you want to install an updated version, uninstall the old plugin first. Then make sure the new zip-file has a different name than the previous version since xbmc seems to cache zip-files and use them instead of the new one if the name is the same.

Status
------
Known to work on raspbmc and xbmc for android. Issues have been reported on openelec. If you've tested in on any other platform, please let me know.
